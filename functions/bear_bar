{ 	My Bearbar will tell whether the last bar is a bearbar.
 	A Bearbar is defined by a bar that:
		- Closes below it's open	
		- Closes in the lower third of the entire bar	}

variables: barSize(0), lowerThird(0);

// Barsize = Value of difference between low and high of the bar
BarSize = H - L;

{	Lower third is calculated byt dividing the size of the bar into three
 	and check if the closing price is in the lower third	} 
lowerThird = L + (Barsize / 3);

{	Creating a statement which validates whether or not we have a
	Bearbar as the last bar and setting the function true or false	}
If C < O and C <= lowerThird then
	begin
		My_Bearbar = True;
	end
	
	else begin
		My_Bearbar = False;
	end;

//Print (lowerThird);
