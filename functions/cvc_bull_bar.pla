{ 	My Bullbar will tell whether the last bar is a bullbar.
 	A bullbar is defined by a bar that:
		- Closes above it's open	
		- Closes in the upper third of the entire bar	}

variables: barSize(0), upperThird(0);

// Barsize = Value of difference between low and high of the bar
BarSize = H - L;

{	Upper third is calculated byt dividing the size of the bar into three
 	and check if the closing price is in the upper third	} 
upperThird = H - (Barsize / 3);

{	Creating a statement which validates whether or not we have a
	bullbar as the last bar and setting the function true or false	}
If C > O and C >= upperThird then
	begin
		My_Bullbar = True;
	end
	
	else begin
		My_Bullbar = False;
	end;
